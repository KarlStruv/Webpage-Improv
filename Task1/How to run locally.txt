1. To run the project, you need to run php files on a local server.
I use XAMPP Apache module for php and MySQL module for the database.
To run the project through Apache server, please place the whole "Task1" folder in XAMPP
sub-folder "htdocs"

2. Create a database in MySQL with the name "insert" and a table named "email" within the db
(these are not definitive and can be named otherwise but need to corrected in the code within
php connections to the database).
If your MySQL admin account doesn't have the default settings(name as "root" and with no password),
please correct the MySQL connection for all php files except index.php and style.php.

3.After a local server and a database is established, open the project with:
/localhost/task1/index.php

and to run the result page with HTML table displaying database data use this:

/localhost/task1/results.php

That's all for running the project.



Please note, that I did not add the last functions of the task. 
Unfortunately, I just couldn't figure out how to make the search function and the sorting function work
at the same time on the HTML page with pure PHP.

Thank you for your time!
